            <h1 class="main-title">Knowledge</h1>
            <p>In 2022, I took ITD 110 Web Design I, where I learned the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. This included project planning, structuring HTML, using HTML tags such as !DOCTYPE, html, head, body, and formatting its content with headers, main, titles (h1 to h6), paragraphs, and footers. I also learned to manage media such as images, videos, and audio, create external and internal links, and the basics of tables and forms.</p>
            <p>In CSS I learned  the differences between inline, internal, and external CSS, and applied various CSS properties such as background, color, text styles, media styles, margins, paddings, and positioning (relative and absolute).</p>

                <h2>Strengths</h2><br>
                <p>I feel confident in the design aspect, applying styles, structuring HTML, reviewing documentation, and understanding the functionality of web pages. I'm comfortable using new features, understanding them, and finding solutions or alternatives to potential design challenges. I know there's always more to learn, but I feel in a good place and open to new challenges.</p>

            <div>
                <h2>Weaknesses</h2><br>
                <p>The most difficult part for me is the initial phase of creating a webpage, from planning to setting up the first step to layout the structure in HTML, it takes me some time. However, once I get started, the process becomes easier and more enjoyable. Another challenge is my perfectionism. I sometimes struggle to let things go and tend to keep adding features, which can make me take longer than expected. Although, It's something I'm working on improving.</p>

            <h2>Additional Web Design Learning</h2><br>
            <p>In addition to the Web Design class, I have also taken a multimedia software class, which helped me better understand design principles, as well as image and video editing in different platforms. These skills can be applied to web page design if needed. I also completed a Web Scripting Languages class, where I learned JavaScript to enhance web page interactivity.</p>

            <p>Beyond my studies at NOVA, I've encourage myself to improve in web design by taking additional courses which I am taking on Codecademy. I've already completed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I'm currently learning React.</p>
