            <h2>My Hobbies</h2><br>
            <p>In my free time, I love spending time outdoors. I enjoy skiing in the winter, my fun activity to make the most of the cold weather, since I'm not a big fan of the cold of winter. During the warmer seasons, I enjoy biking and hiking, spending as much time outdoors as I can. I am always trying to find ways to stay active. Recently, I've started running at least twice a week and working out at home every day. I am working on committing to a healthier lifestyle. It's never too late to start. </p>

            <h2>Relax and Recharge</h2><br>
            <p>When I'm not outdoors, I enjoy reading. I just finished Into the Water by Paula Hawkins and am currently reading It Ends with Us by Colleen Hoover. Reading relax me and help me to take a break from stress from everyday. I also enjoy watching movies, and series, it's another great way to relax for a while.</p>

            <p>Family and friends are very important to me, and I believe that the moments we share with loved ones are some of the most valuable in life.</p>
