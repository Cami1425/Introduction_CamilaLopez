            <p>I would like to continue learning and exploring the latest versions of HTML and CSS, particularly focusing on designing responsive websites and their new features. After reviewing the course syllabus, I'm especially interested in improving my understanding of Flexbox and Grid. I've been exploring Flexbox on my own, but my goal is to learn how to use it effectively, which will help me to professionalize my web design and development skills and become more competitive in the job market.</p>
            <p>I've been researching the job market and I've noticed that many positions require knowledge of Bootstrap, which is another topic covered in this class. I believe learning Bootstrap will be a valuable addition to my professional skills, and it will help me grow as a web designer and developer.</p>
