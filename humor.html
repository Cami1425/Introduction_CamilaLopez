            <h1>Something Funny</h1><br>
            <p>I'm not very good at telling jokes or funny stories, but here goes. This probably doesn't need to be about technology, but I can't think of anything else! So... after I finished my first Information Systems Technology classes, a friend once called my husband for help with his computer. My husband is a software engineer, and after helping our friend, I asked him what the issue was. He replied, "Layer 8 problem." He was so happy to see that I finally understood tech jokes, and now it's a little inside joke between us.</p>
            <p>I'm also including a funny image I found online!</p>
